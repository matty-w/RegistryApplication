    checkbox located in the row of the entry you wish to delete in the Registry Table, and then pressing the 'Delete'
    button. The Application will then prompt you as to whether you are sure you wish to delete the Entries you have
    selected, if you then select 'Yes' from this prompt, the Application will delete the entries. If you have changed
